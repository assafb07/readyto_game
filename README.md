# readyto_game

Every time before I am running a game I open some programs and close some other. 
So this program can do it automaticlly. 
It reads from a txt file the programs I want to run and close.

the txt looks like this:

game = open : "C:\Program Files\CPUID\HWMonitor\HWMonitor.exe" | "C:\Program Files (x86)\MSI Afterburner\MSI Afterburner.exe"
game = close : tixati | express | Greenshot.exe | update | ace  | chrome |  brave 

you can change it but by the rule

game = open : "<progrm to open path>"  | "<progrm to open path>" 
game = close : <name 01> | <name 02>
