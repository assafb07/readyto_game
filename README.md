# readyto_game

Every time before I am running a game I open some programs and close some other. 
So this program can do it automaticlly. 

the txt looks like this:
you can change it but by the rule

game = open : "<progrm to open path>"  | "<progrm to open path>" 
game = close : <name 01> | <name 02>
